  </div>
  <p>
    The GROW conference (Graduate Research Opportunities for Women) is for all students of
    underrepresented gender identities in mathematics, especially female students, who are
    interested in learning about graduate programmes and further opportunities in research, both
    within and outside academia. Its primary goal is to promote research in applied and pure
    mathematics as a career choice, encourage young women to apply to graduate (Master's and PhD)
    programs, and provide tools to navigate both the application process and life as a Master's/PhD
    student. It aims to highlight the positive aspects of being a part of the academic environment,
    the experiences and lessons from acquiring a PhD, and the career paths open after graduate
    school.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conference is inspired by the successful North American GROW conference series, which has
    been held annually since 2015

    <p><strong>The steering committee:</strong></p>
    <p>
      The steering committee, formed in 2025, ensures continuity, unanimity, and adherence to the
      underlying vision for the European GROW series. It also recruits host institutions for GROW
      and provides advice and support to the local organizing committees. The steering committee
      currently consists of the following members:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://pbelmans.ncag.info">Pieter Belmans</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://ydutta.github.io">Yajnaseni Dutta</a></li>

      <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/laurawakelin">Laura Wakelin</a></li>
    </ul>
    The committee is approved by all current organisers of the European GROW conference. It will be
    updated regularly to ensure diverse representation. All current and future organisers of GROW
    conferences are encouraged to join the steering committee after their event.

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The European GROW conferences have been hosted annually since 2022 by various institutes and
    universities, making a profound impact on participants' perspectives on careers in mathematics.
  </p>

  <p>Some testimonials from previous attendees:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst-italic">
      "I loved it! I'm not exaggerating when I say that GROW completely changed my perspective on my
      major and my future as a math major. I will treasure the memories I made at GROW for the rest
      of my undergraduate career."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst-italic">
      "I left the conference more convinced than ever that I can and will make it to graduate
      school... I've completely abandoned my subconsciously-harbored conception that mathematics
      is a gentlemen's club."
    </p>
