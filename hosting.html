    <strong>The conference:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        typically takes place annually in the spring, over the course of two to three working days
      </li>
      <li>
        is primarily open to students who are currently enrolled in a European bachelor's or
        master's program, including international students.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>
    Hosts are typically departments or groups of departments offering Ph.D. programs in the
    mathematical sciences. We help the organising committees to prepare proposals; however, they are
    responsible for securing all necessary funding.

  too. Typical expenses include: travel and three nights accommodation for 50 individuals including
